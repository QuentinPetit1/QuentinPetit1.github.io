I am a researcher in Mathematics at EDF R&D and FiME Lab.

My research focuses on non-atomic games, particularly mean field games, optimisation, and control theory, with an emphasis on their applications to economics. 

I defended my <a href="https://theses.fr/2022UPSLD004">Ph. D thesis</a> in February 2022.
