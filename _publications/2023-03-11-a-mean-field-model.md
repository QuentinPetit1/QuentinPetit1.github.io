We consider an economy made of competing firms which are heterogeneous in their capital and use several inputs for producing goods. Their consumption policy is fixed rationally by maximizing a utility and their capital cannot fall below a given threshold (state constraint). We aim at modeling the interactions between firms on the markets of the different inputs on the long term. The stationary equlibria are described by a system of coupled non-linear differential equations: a Hamiltonâ€“Jacobi equation describing the optimal control problem of a single atomistic firm; a continuity equation describing the distribution of the individual state variable (the capital) in the population of firms; the equilibria on the markets of the production factors. We prove the existence of equilibria under suitable assumptions.
