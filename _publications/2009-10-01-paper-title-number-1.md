title: "A Simple City Equilibrium Model with an Application to Teleworking"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-08-11-paper-title-number
excerpt: 'We propose a simple semi-discrete spatial model where rents, wages and the density of population in a city can be deduced from free-mobility and equilibrium conditions on the labour and residential housing markets. We prove existence and (under stronger assumptions) uniqueness of the equilibrium. We extend our model to the case where teleworking is introduced. We present numerical simulations which shed light on the effect of teleworking on the structure of the city at equilibrium.'
